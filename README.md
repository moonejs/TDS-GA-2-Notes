# GA-2 TDS Assignment Notes

This repository contains my notes for the GA-2 Tools in Data Science (TDS) assignment.

The goal of this repo is to explain the concepts used in the assignment in simple and clear language so that anyone can understand what is happening and why we are using certain Git commands.

I have written the steps in an easy, practical way instead of copying theory from the internet.

## What This Repository Contains

- Explanation of the Git concepts used in the assignment  
- Step-by-step procedure to solve the case study  
- Important commands with simple meaning  
- Small reasoning behind each step  
- Good practices related to Git security

## How These Notes Are Written

- Concepts are explained in simple words  
- Only the required commands are shown  
- Some commands are intentionally skipped  

The reason I skipped some commands is so that you can also explore and practice on your own instead of just copying everything blindly.

Learning Git becomes easier when you try a few steps yourself.
